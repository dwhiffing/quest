  title: CHANGING PEOPLE’S LIVES WITH QUEST TO CONQUER CANCER
  subtitle: Nearly 1 in 3 North Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime.
    The need to continue to fund world-leading research is vital, because it offers
    real hope to patients living with cancer. We are always pushing the envelope –  in
    our research labs, with patient care and even in  the way we raise the funds for
    these critical programs. I’m excited to announce the launch of Quest to Conquer
    Cancer and build a community of gamers who are using their passion to fundraise
    in support of The Princess Margaret. <br><br>I’m looking forward to seeing gamers
    unite around the world as we launch our first fundraising season for Quest which
    will culminate in an epic fundraising finale in December. <br><br>The funds that
    Questers help raise allow The Princess Margaret to remain as one of the top 5
    cancer research centres in the world. Many of our world-leading researchers are
    making the impossible possible, thanks to the tremendous philanthropic support
    that comes from our Questers, donors, volunteers and supporters.<br><br>The Princess
    Margaret is transforming cancer care across the globe thanks to advances in technology,
    fueled by the innovation of our cancer experts and the generosity of our community.
    By joining Quest, you are helping us to advance on our vision, to Conquer Cancer
    In Our Lifetime.<br><br>Join the movement. Join the Quest!<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Michael
    Burns<br>President & CEO
