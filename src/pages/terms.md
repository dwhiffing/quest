  content: 'We have prepared the following so that You understand the uses and limitations
    of our services. As a general policy no personally identifiable information, such
    as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your
    visit to the Site. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the
    standard operation of Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser
    being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to
    enhance your online experience in the Site. The various registration forms, on-line
    order forms, and surveys may request that you provide personal information (such
    as your name, mailing, and e-mail address), demographic information (such as your
    age and gender), and profile data (such as your preferences in entertainment).
    You may also opt-in to sharing such information with us through contests or links
    through our promotional or business partners. Information submitted at the time
    of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes,
    and may be shared with our affiliates, or with business or promotional partners,
    with your consent. With your permission, we may use your contact information to
    send you information about us. You may always opt-out of receiving future mailings
    (see the Choice/Opt-out section below). We collect personal information about
    individual users when such personal information is provided to us on a voluntary
    basis, for the following purposes: (a) to monitor traffic to the Site; (b) to
    determine the future direction of the Site including any necessary technical upgrades;
    (c) to contact you regarding future services or changes to the Site; (d) to process
    purchase orders for Universal products; (e) to promote Universal and for marketing
    purposes; (f) to respond to customer inquiries and comments; (g) to maintain a
    list of customers; and (h) to personalize your shopping experience by using your
    site behavior to shape any recommendations about products which may interest you.
    By providing the personal information to us, you agree and consent to the collection,
    use and/or disclosure of such information by Universal for the purposes stated
    above. Universal may also use or transfer personal information to its affiliates
    for the purposes of review, storage and processing. Personal information about
    users will not be sold to third parties, and will not be otherwise transferred
    to third parties for any uses other than those purposes stated above, without
    the user’s express and informed approval.'
  security: For all personally identifiable information is extremely important to
    us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to
    be 100% secure. Once we receive your transmission, we will use best efforts to
    ensure its security on our systems. When you register or place an order, it’s
    done through a secure server. By using 128-bit encryption through Secure Socket
    Layers (SSL), the most advanced security available today, we ensure that your
    information will remain encrypted until it reaches the server. Only then is it
    decrypted for use on shipping labels or contest ballots, for example.
  cookies: 'Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s
    computer hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make using the Site easier
    by, among other things, saving your passwords and preferences for you. As an example,
    Universal uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart when you visit our
    online store, and help identify you when you return to the Store. These cookies
    are restricted for use only on the Site, and do not transfer any personal information
    to any other party. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however,
    you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is
    being sent. (Note: you will need to consult the help area of your browser application
    for instructions.) If you choose to disable your cookies setting or refuse to
    accept a cookie, some parts of the Site will not function properly or may be considerably
    slower. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized
    preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering
    contests, or playing games.'
